		species_bio="The arrival of the alien Tyrum nearly extinguished mankind. After seven years of apocalyptic conflict, the myriad nations of Earth were reduced to a makeshift and desperate military coalition, achieving victory through enormous sacrifice. 

With human civilization on the brink of total collapse, the measures taken to preserve what little remained were brutal and at times, cruel. Amidst famine, poverty, and despair however, there awoke a new sense of purpose and responsibility. When global order was restored, humanity placed their faith in the coalition and this emergency provisional government reorganized itself into the Greater Terran Union. 

The petty conflicts and divisions that for millennia splintered humanity have now been burned away. The swords of man are united; the Tyrum, and the galaxy, will tremble at their might."

Their technology is not their own, taken from the so called “Old Ones” although the relationship between the Tyrum and this long dead civilization is not understood.
